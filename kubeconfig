Kube config file : A file that is used to configure clusters is called kube config file 

By default kubectl looks for a file named config  in the $HOME/.kube directory.

we can specify other kubeconfig files by setting KUBECONFIG environment variable or by setting the kubeconfig flag 

kubeconfig is in specific format 
- clusters - multiple clusters for diff environments
- Users - Admin user, dev user, prod user 
- contexts - Admin@Production this will use the admin account access a prod cluster; Dev@Google access with dev credentials 

Note: we are not creating any new users or configuring any kind of user access or authorization in the cluster with this process 
we are using existing users with th existing priviledges and defining wht user we are going to access what cluster tht way we dont have to specify user certificates and server address in eacha nd every kubectl command it run

--server my-kube-playground:6443
--client-key admin.key
--client-certificate admin.crt
--certificate-authority ca.crt

server specification will goes in to the - clusters section 
Admin users keys and certificates goes in to the  --client-key admin.key ,--client-certificate admin.crt-users 
contexts specifies to use my-kube-admin user to access the my kube playground cluster
